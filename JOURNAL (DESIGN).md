# Custom-Keyboard Project


## Schematics

I want to make a keyboard with a 60% key layout that has a added row on top for a OLED screen, two rotary encoders, and two toggle switches. I started off doing the basic keyboard matrix and quickly moving on to adding the OLED and rotary encoders. While wiring to the pico, I realized I didn't have enough gpio space for all the electronics. To solve this, I added an mcp23017 to give me more room. After adding it, I realized I also had space for WS2812B leds. I spent maybe 30 minutes adding all the leds, and then moved on to PCB mode.

## Orienting Everything in PCB Mode 

I started off with the edge cut for the board outline, and then setting the grid to the distancing between keys, and placing diodes in between. Positioning the rotary encoders, screen, and toggle switches were also pretty easy. The LEDs where my main problem in the PCB editor, after placing a few of them I realized that the LED wouldn't be able to fit on the top side of the board and that they would be crushed by the switches, so I switched it to the bottom layer. After switching layers, the LEDs did give enough room for the keys, but they now faced downwards. I asked a friend and they recommended I use the Sk6812 Mini E Reverse Mount for my keyboard. I found a footprint of the LED and switched all WS2812bBs to the new LEDs, but the LED's footprint was messed up, and I spent around an hour trying to fix it until I just gave up and asked claude. It told me to downlaod one off a github repo, and luckily it worked. I spent another 40 minutes orienting all the LEDs. After finishing, I realized I could add hotswap sockets to make the pcb have holes for the pins in each key instead of having to solder each one on and off. I spent another hour adding the sockets.

## Routing

I spent around 2 hours routing my keyboard until I realized that I had the diodes connected to each other in a random order, and had to redo their nets in the schematic editor, and then delete all the routed wires. On my second try my routing vastly improved and it took me maybe an hour and thirty minutes to do everything. I started with 5V to the leds and some of the special electronics, and then 3V3 and SDA and SCK. After that I redid the keyboard matrix with my newly organized diodes and connected the other component's data paths like the toggle switches, rotary encoders, and OLED. I spent maybe 30 minutes playing with the ground fill and another hour making DRC stop having a panic attack, and finally was done routing.

**Total time spent: 3 hours**

## Cadding Case

I made my case around the imported 3D model of the pcb. I made the plate and top part split into three pieces to fit on the printer bed, and have a interlocking zigzag connection that will be secured with glue after printing.

**Total time spent: 30 minutes**

## Adding silkscreen

I added an explosion svg lol. For some reason the svg was imported in fully colored in, so it took a little to remove background.

**Total time spent: 10 minutes**

## Added data shifter

I spent around 2 hours adding a data shifter for the LEDs, realized I needed one, luckily I ordered one already for another project, and don't have to add to BOM. Had to rearrange some routing, and also realized that resistor had wrong footprint and fixed that.

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

## Replaced GPIO extender

Replaced the MCP23017 with smaller one that uses scl instead of sck (PCF8574AP) and added HC logo silkscreen. Also added resistors and swapped C11 with C13 on pico to PCF8574AP. Took forever rerouting stuff. This whole process took 2 hours.

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

## Had wrong level shifter footprint, changed

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

Had footprint for a SN74AH14 instead of a SN74AHCT125N, replaced, and also added a couple resistors for scl  and sda and rearranged capacitor for leds. I also added more silkscreens.

## Combined C0 with other columns.
 
 Combined C0 with other columns so that I don't have one column on the PCF8574AP, and added bambu labs logo silkscreen and my very questionable signature.

**Total time spent: 2 hours**

## Finalizing repo.

Replaced all outdated files, made readme, formatted journal. For some reason my schematic reverted to previous version and I needed to redo capacitors.

**Total time spent: 1 hour**

## Finalized code with qmk.

Talked a bit with perplexity and final code is now finished, I will tweak a little if I run into problems when I have the physical keyboard.

**Total time spent: 1 hour**

## Replaced wrong KCD1 THT footrpint

Made a custom footprint for the kcd1, I'm going to solder the pins onto the pcb, but I had a wrong footprint that made small pin holes, and I had to make my own in footprint editor and implement it into the pcb.

**Total time spent: 30 minutes**

## Added 3d models and fixed footprints

Added all 3D models to board, using step files from grabcad and printables. For some reason some of my footprints were deleted, or switched to other footprints, so I fixed that as well, I also changed the switch's pad orientation because they were a little off centered, and fixed the holes for the hotswap extender thingies because the holes were also a little off centered and they would have had to be sqeezed and potentioally broken to get them to fit. I am pretty confident that I am done with everything.

**Total time spent: 3 hours 30 minutes**

## Updated level shifter footprint.
Replaced old footprint from default pin header to actual 3d model of the SN74AHCT125N.

**Total time spent: 30 minutes**

## Added screw mounting holes.

Found footprint and placed mounting holes in the four corners of the pcb. Needed to do a little rerouting, but did it pretty easily.

**Total time spent: 20 minutes**

## Updated PCB mounting and plate mounting system, and made a assembly animation.

Added a new screw hole mount to the actual cad for the pcb, and added a extrusion in the case that holds the plate up. Also used blender animation tools to make a fire assembly animation.

**Total time spent: 1 hour**

## Changed spacebar key to 6u because i cant find any sets with 7u lol.

Changed spacebar footprint and updated routing along it. Also updated BOM.

**Total time spent: 30 minutes**

## Fixed silkscreen for hotswaps.
Silkscreen was completely on f.cu, moved hotswap parts to back side. Looking good, I'm pretty confident that I am done.

**Total time spent: 30 minutes**

## Added USB C Hole.

Made a usbc cutout and applied boolean, and then uploaded to stl folder and converted to step. Now I'm done lol.

## Final documentation edits.

Updated BOM, gerber/drill files, added renders to readme, updated journal, and generally polished everything up.

## Sorting all the random pcb components into collections and then redid assemby.

The keybaord was basically returned because my assembly sucks. So I fixed it. But, it was lazy for a specific reason. If I export the cad as a glb, it puts everything in a node, and it scales it to a thousandth of the size. The nodes for some reason are randomly linked to other objects for some reason, so say I move a switch on the right of the keyboard, it will also move a diode on the complete opposite side in the same way. I spent 30 literal minutes being confused and moving stuff around. Then I gave up and deleted everything, and re addded the pcb files. I un-noded everything, but then I realized that it multiplied the amount of objects by like 5. For some reason, each led took up 5 different objects that are in completely differant areas on the parts list, one object for the main led, and then 4 more for each singlar pin extruding it. The keys also took up two objects each, one for casing, one for + thing on top, and the hotswaps took up 3 objects, one for main hotswap part, two for pins extruding from it. So I had to painstakingly sort over 600 objects into 12 differant folders. This took me around 2 hours, 40 minutes. I then chose to skip renaming every part, because for some reason random components had names like this. **=>[0:1:1:30].057** I dont knwo why the hell they had names like that, ask kicad.  I also had to redo the colors on some imported parts because a few specific part had just see through materials for some stupid fucking reason, so I just went around copying and pasting hex codes for 30 minutes. I finally finished sorting everything, and animated it. The animation is pretty simple, it took 30 minutes to make. I was so tired that instead of setting up a camera and lighting, I just took a screen recording in material preview mode. It also took me around 20 minutes to upload and change everything in github.
